This project is build to use all technologies learned in Web Technologies course (UE19CS204) up until this point and familiarizing oneself with of various new frameworks.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React bootstrap, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a server folder to take care of the backend.
